# Overview
- Developed a ping pong game using python and the turtle library.
- The game is meant to be played by two players. 
- Use "w" and "s" to control left paddle.
- Use "up arrow" and "down arrow" to control right paddle.
- The ball speed increases after every successful paddle bounce.
- A player scores when the ball reaches the opponent's wall bounds.
- First player to score six points wins.

# Note
 - Holding the key to move the paddle does not work. 
 - Player must tap the key in order to move their paddle.
 - The top wall is the top of the screen, meaning it is possible for the ball to over lap with the scoreboard.
